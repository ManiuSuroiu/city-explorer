# city-explorer
an app that lets users find interesting places around them.
it uses Core Location an MapKit as well as third party APIs from Foursquare and Uber.
the app so far has the user location functionality alongside error checking code and also the network request and parsing JSON from Foursquare although it needs some refactoring.
